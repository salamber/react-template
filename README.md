# react-template

This is a minimalist React template I have made since I find that _create-react-app_ have too many dependencies. It uses _Parcel_ as its bundler and it offers reasonable configuration files for ESLint and Prettier.

#### Installing dependencies

```console
$ yarn install
```

#### Starting development server (watching for changes)

```console
$ yarn dev
```

#### Building production assets

```console
$ yarn build
```

#### Formatting code

```console
$ yarn format
```

#### Running linter

```console
$ yarn lint
```
